  heading: OUR TOP-OF-THE-LINE TECHNOLOGIES
  text: AT NU DENTISTRY, STRESS-FREE DENTAL CARE IS POSSIBLE WITH US
  content: Our modern Houston dental office is designed with our patients' total comfort
    in mind. We're not content with just satisfactory dental care—we make sure that
    we're unmatched in our field. Nu Dentistry is equipped with the latest and greatest
    dental technologies, devices, and techniques to guarantee you always get the most
    efficient and comprehensive care possible. All of our treatments are painless.
    When you come in for your dental treatment, we don't just content ourselves with
    your local anesthesia fully numbing the area to be worked on. We make sure that
    administering your anesthesia is just as painless, too! Instead of using scary-looking
    needles like other dental offices, all of our dentists use Dentapen applicators,
    which release the numbing agent gently and slowly to significantly reduce any
    discomfort you may feel. We also apply every method we can, from warming up the
    anesthesia beforehand to totally camouflaging the injection with DentalVibe, to
    make everything as smooth and painless for you as possible. Our dentists understand
    that a trip to the dentist can seem daunting, so we stop at nothing to ensure
    your total comfort and satisfaction. For those patients with dental anxiety or
    who want to complete multiple procedures in a single visit, we also have available
    upon request several safe and relaxing <a href='/houston-tx/specialty-dentistry/sedation-dentistry/'
    target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>sedation options</a>. From laughing gas
    and oral sedation to both conscious and unconscious IV sedation, our dentists
    are fully prepared to help you stay calm and comfortable, both in body and mind,
    throughout your visit. Do you have any other questions about the amazing technologies
    we have in our Houston office? Don't hesitate to give us a call at <a href='tel:+8329164144'
    title='Click to Call Us'>(832) 916-4144</a>! We're eager to share with you everything
    we've put together for your benefit.

  - heading: IS YOUR DENTAL OFFICE OPEN SATURDAYS?
    content: At Nu Dentistry, our dentists understand that not everyone can come in
      during their 8am to 5pm work days. After all, we know that you’re just as busy
      as us! That’s why, in addition to our normal weekday hours, we’re also open
      on Saturdays from 9am to 3pm. We want to make sure that you’re always able to
      get the treatment you need, without all the stress of rearranging your schedule
      or using your precious sick and vacation days.
  - heading: WHAT PROCEDURES CAN DENTISTS DO AT YOUR OFFICE?
    content: Nu Dentistry keeps everything as in-house as we can, meaning we offer
      our patients a wide range of procedures to their total satisfaction. Some of
      our available treatments include general hygiene appointments, deep cleanings,
      cosmetic treatments like Invisalign, whitening, and veneers, crowns and root
      canals, tooth extractions, dental implants, dentures, and sedation dentistry.
      If you have any inquiries about our full list of procedures, call our office
      today at <a href='tel:+8329164144' title='Click to Call Us'>(832) 916-4144</a>
      to speak to one of our expert staff.
  - heading: DO YOU TAKE WALK-IN APPOINTMENTS?
    content: We pride ourselves on our ability to make sure no one spends more than
      5 minutes in our waiting room, walk-ins included. Nu Dentistry follows a philosophy
      of total convenience for all of our patients, and we take it to heart from the
      moment you come through our front doors. We always leave a little leeway in
      our schedules, especially for dental emergencies, to make sure everyone gets
      the attention and care they need immediately.
  - heading: HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU GO TO THE DENTIST?
    content: You should be scheduling your next appointments at least every 6 months
      for your general <a href='/houston-tx/general-dentistry/dental-cleaning/' target='_blank'
      class='paragraph-link'>cleaning and exam</a>. This is the perfect amount of
      time for our expert dentists to clean your teeth of any acid, bacteria, or plaque
      buildup that wants to weaken and damage them. For some patients with a history
      of extensive dental work, however, your hygienist or dentist may recommend that
      you come in to see us every 3 or 4 months. This preventative care ensures that
      your smile stays happy and healthy more successfully.
  - heading: DOES YOUR DENTAL OFFICE ACCEPT PPO INSURANCE?
    content: Yes, our office accepts all PPO insurance. We want to give our patients
      the chance to get the best treatment and level of coverage possible without
      worrying about networks or referrals from insurance specialists.
  - heading: CAN A DENTIST GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR ANXIETY?
    content: Our dentists understand that it can be nerve wracking coming in for a
      treatment, especially if you have dental anxiety. To help soothe your fears
      and relax your mind, we have a variety of safe dental sedation options, including
      laughing gas and oral sedation. We put your comfort as our top priority because
      we want to make sure that your experience with us is always the best.
