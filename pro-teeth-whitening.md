  heading: MAKE YOUR SMILE SHINE WITH TEETH WHITENING IN HOUSTON
  text: GET A CELEBRITY-WHITE SMILE IN A SINGLE VISIT!
  content: |-
    Coffee, tea, and wine are tempting… but they also stain your teeth. Here at Nu Dentistry, we know the best methods to regain your bright white smile with our in-house professional teeth whitening system! More advanced than over the counter treatments, our teeth whitening systems bring you longer-lasting and brighter results in less time!

    Teeth whitening is the quickest and most traditional treatment used in <a href='/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/aesthetic-dentistry/' target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>cosmetic dentistry</a>, offering your smile an instant boost! Our non-invasive and effective whitening options include both an in-house teeth whitening treatment and take-home whitening trays.

    Teeth whitening can remove years of stains and discoloration, but it’s not a permanent solution. Depending on your lifestyle and habits, you may likely need additional whitening treatments in the future. However, your professional smile whitening results can last years longer than those with a take-home teeth whitening kit from the store.

    To make sure you get the most out of your sessions, we will also give you at-home care instructions and tips that will help you maintain and extend the lifespan of your bright smile.

    Ready to add some sparkle to your smile and try our teeth whitening systems? Call for a consultation today!

  - heading: IN-OFFICE BLEACHING
    copy: The quickest and most powerful way to whiten your teeth is to come into
      our clinic for a professional bleaching. A gel or a plastic guard is used to
      protect your gums. We also offer laser whitening to better your results. At
      Nu Dentistry, we use the Beyond whitening system because we believe in giving
      you results that surpass your best expectations. Most patients only need one
      visit for treatment, and the entire process takes only 15 to 30 minutes.

  - heading: TAKE-HOME WHITENING TRAYS AND GELS
    copy: You can complete your teeth whitening at home with clear trays tailored
      to you using impressions of your teeth. We'll prepare your teeth with a <a href='/houston-tx/general-dentistry/dental-cleaning/'
      target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>thorough dental cleaning</a> before you
      start using the trays. We'll then provide you with the bleaching gel that you'll
      use for 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the results you want. This method takes more
      sessions to finish, but you'll get the same fantastic results as you would with
      in-office treatment.

  - heading: WHITENING STRIPS
    copy: These are the kits you see in every drug store and supermarket. Each strip
      contains a gel similar to the custom trays you can get from your dentist, but
      the bleaching solution used is much weaker. Your results will be much more gradual,
      and you won't get the same level of brightness as professional methods.

  heading: FOODS TO AVOID TO MAINTAIN YOUR BRIGHTNESS
  text: WE WANT YOU TO GET THE BEST RESULTS AND MAKE THEM LAST AS LONG AS POSSIBLE!
  content: |-
    Did you just get your teeth whitened, and you want to show them off to the world? Great! Your teeth are looking younger than they have in more than a decade, and you should be proud of them. However, teeth whitening isn't a permanent solution, and the stains you had didn't come from nowhere. You have to be careful about what you eat. Eating or drinking foods that stain your teeth can reduce the longevity of your smile whitening, and leave you with results that last you months rather than years. Here are some food and drinks you should avoid:

    - Coffee, tea, and sodas
    - Dark berries, like blueberries
    - Sauces like tomato sauce and soy sauce
    - Balsamic vinegar
    - Popsicles, licorice, and other heavily dyed treats
    - Red Wines

    Enjoying these foods isn't going to ruin your teeth immediately. However, we do recommend that you stay away from them entirely for at least 48 hours after getting your teeth whitened professionally. Having these foods in moderation only as well as maintaining good dental hygiene are the best ways to keep your teeth shining.

  - heading: IS TEETH WHITENING BAD FOR YOUR TEETH?
    content: When used as instructed, teeth whitening is perfectly safe for your teeth!
      Going to your dentist for your whitening is much safer than generic over-the-counter
      whitening methods. At Nu Dentistry, we only use the best dentist-recommended
      teeth whitening systems available. We know what works best for your teeth, and
      we're dedicated to your complete smile satisfaction.
  - heading: HOW DO CELEBRITIES GET THEIR TEETH SO WHITE?
    content: You may have noticed that nearly all celebrities have teeth that almost
      seem to outshine the sun. That's because they routinely visit the dentist in-person
      for a regular smile whitening session. They also follow up with good dental
      hygiene and habits that preserve the brightness of their teeth as long as possible,
      such as staying away from soda and wine when they can. Some celebrities get
      <a href='/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/porcelain-veneers/' target='_blank'
      class='paragraph-link'>veneers</a> instead if they also want to change the look
      and shape of their teeth as well.
  - heading: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LASER TEETH WHITENING AND BLEACHING?
    content: Laser teeth whitening can be done in the dentist's office, and a single
      treatment only takes 15-60 minutes. Within a single session, you'll start to
      see results, and you can take off years of stains in as little as four sessions.
      Bleaching can be done at home with fitted trays and are great for people with
      more sensitive teeth. They take more applications to finish your treatment,
      but they're also much more cost-efficient than laser whitening.
  - heading: HOW MANY DAYS AFTER TEETH WHITENING CAN I DRINK COFFEE?
    content: After your in-house whitening, we recommend that you stay away from coffee
      and other dark, staining foods for at least 48 hours. Your teeth will be porous
      in the following days, meaning that they are especially vulnerable to staining.
      After this time, we recommend that you enjoy your coffee in moderation—it stained
      your teeth before, and it can do so again.
  - heading: How can I whiten my teeth quickly?
    content: The fastest way to whiten your teeth is to visit your dentist for an
      in-house whitening session. The whitening can be done after your routine dental
      cleaning and only takes 30 minutes to an hour to complete. By the time you leave
      our office, you'll find your smile shining 2 to 3 shades brighter.
  - heading: DO OVER-THE-COUNTER TEETH WHITENERS WORK?
    content: Yes, over-the-counter methods do work, but they're nowhere near as effective
      as if you went to a teeth whitening dentist. Their effects are more gradual,
      sometimes taking days or weeks for a visible difference. They also won't whiten
      your smile as much as professional systems.
