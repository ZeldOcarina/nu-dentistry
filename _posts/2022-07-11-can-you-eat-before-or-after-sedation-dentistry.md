## What is Sedation Dentistry?

During dental operations, sedation dentistry makes you feel at peace, calm, and relaxed. Because of the moderate dose of sedation, you are technically still awake, but extremely relaxed. Due to the short-term amnesia (forgetfulness) it induces, sometimes known as "twilight sleep," where you become less sensitive to pain without losing consciousness, it is also sometimes referred to as conscious sedation dentistry.

## Can You Eat Before or After Sedation Dentistry?

Patients who have anxiety when visiting the dentist frequently benefit from [sedation dentistry](https://www.nudentistry.com/are-you-a-suitable-candidate-for-sedation-dentistry/), also known as "sleep dentistry." Anxiety or even phobia about seeing the dentist is prevalent, especially among adults. Because of this dread, a lot of people put off or skip going to the dentist, which can result in poor oral health and issues like gum disease or tooth decay. It's a little contradictory because putting off going to the dentist might actually result in more serious tooth issues that eventually require more procedures to fix.

Many people are unsure of how they should eat before receiving sedation dentistry. It's crucial to follow your dentist's dietary instructions precisely because failing to do so could damage your treatment or perhaps reduce the sedation's effectiveness. Depending on the type of sedation used, different guidelines apply to eating before and after sedation dentistry.

**The most popular forms of sedation and associated recommendations regarding what to eat before and after are listed below:**

* Nitrous Oxide: This gas, also referred to as "laughing gas," is inhaled during a dental procedure to help you feel more at ease. This is the least severe type of sedation. It is advised that you avoid eating for at least a couple hours prior to the treatment because nitrous oxide may cause you to feel queasy. There are no dietary limitations after receiving [nitrous oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide), so you can eat whenever you feel ready.
* Oral Sedation: Oral sedation is administered orally and comes in pill form. You will have mild to severe drowsiness as a result. Unless your dentist instructs you otherwise, you should wait six hours before eating anything. It's crucial to stay hydrated after the treatment by consuming lots of water. Ask your dentist because it depends on the treatment and the sedation method used whether you can eat afterward.
* Intravenous (IV) Sedation: The deepest level of conscious sedation available in a dental office setting is IV sedation dentistry. The dentist can manage the level of sedation by administering via an intravenous drip. The ideal candidates for this technique are those who are going through extensive procedures or who have significant dental anxiety. Nothing should be consumed for at least six hours prior to the surgery, as this must be done on an empty stomach.
* Deep sedation and general anesthesia: Deep sedation causes complete unconsciousness for the patient, who won't awaken until the anesthetic wears off. You should not eat for six hours before your appointment, just like with IV sedation.

These are general principles, every situation is different. [Ask your dentist](https://www.nudentistry.com/houston-tx/specialty-dentistry/sedation-dentistry/) when it is safe to eat before and after sedation dentistry.
