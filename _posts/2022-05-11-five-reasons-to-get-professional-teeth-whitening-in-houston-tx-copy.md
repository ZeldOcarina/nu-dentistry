title: What You Need To Know About Dental Implants In Houston, Tx

---
A missing tooth is a problem that most people would like to avoid. In fact, it’s one of the top reasons for tooth loss in adults today. Fortunately, there are many solutions available for those who have lost their teeth and want them back! One such solution is a [dental implant](http://50.18.194.110:40030/houston-tx/restorative-dentistry/dental-implants/), which can replace your missing tooth with an artificial root that works just as well as a natural one.

Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth and provide a natural-looking alternative to dentures. They can also help improve chewing ability by providing additional stability for your jawbone.

## What are dental implants?

Dental implants are a popular and effective way to replace a missing tooth. They are composed of three parts: the implant, abutment, and [crown](http://50.18.194.110:40030/houston-tx/restorative-dentistry/tooth-crown/). The implant is surgically placed in the jawbone, and the abutment is secured to the implant. The crown is then attached to the abutment, creating a replacement tooth.

In addition to being strong and looking natural, dental implants also serve an important purpose. Besides preserving bone density, they also boost the aesthetic appeal of the smile. Consult a dentist at Nu Dentistry about whether dental implants are right for you if you are considering them.

## What are the benefits of dental implants?

There are many benefits to getting dental implants. If you have missing teeth, it can lead to problems like the inability to chew your food properly and even malnutrition. Dental implants can help by giving you back your smile and chewing capabilities.

Natural-looking dental implants can replace a missing tooth due to injury or the removal of a tooth through extraction.

Dental implants also provide stability and support for the surrounding teeth, which is beneficial in preventing tooth decay and bone loss around your mouth. In addition to that, dental implants help you maintain healthy gums by healing infections faster than traditional dentures would.

## How much do dental implants cost?

The cost of dental implants will vary depending on your individual needs. Since each patient has different needs, it is hard to estimate the exact cost of dental implants without a consultation with your dentist or orthodontist. However, most clinics offer financing plans for treatments, so you don’t have to pay all at once.

## How are dental implants placed?

When you think of dental implants, you may wonder how they are placed. Implants are basically screws that are placed into the jawbone to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. Dental implants can be placed during one appointment in most cases. The implant is surgically placed into the jawbone and allowed to heal for a few months before the dental restoration is attached. The entire process usually takes around six months from start to finish.

## Are there any risks associated with dental implants?

[Dental implants](https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/i/Implants) have been around for many years and are considered a safe and effective way to replace missing teeth. While dental implants are typically very reliable, there are some risks associated with them. However, these risks are very low and can be minimized by choosing a qualified implant dentist. Some of the risks associated with dental implants include infection, dental implant failure, nerve damage, or sinus problems.

If you are considering dental implants, be sure to consult with a qualified implant dentist to learn more about this treatment option.

## What is the aftercare when receiving dental implants?

Many people who have dental implants are confused about aftercare. There is no need to be alarmed, post-surgery care is easy and simple!

Once the dental implants are placed, you will be given a set of instructions to follow. Typically, you will need to avoid eating crunchy or sticky foods for the first few days after surgery. You should also avoid smoking and drinking alcohol, as they can slow down the healing process.

You will also be required to take antibiotics if you have a dental implant placed under the gums. If you do not follow these aftercare instructions, your dental implants may fail and will require additional surgery to replace them.

## What is the recovery time for dental implants?

After receiving dental implants, there isn’t much downtime. You can go back to work immediately in most cases, but it’s best if you take off from work the day of your implant appointment. It’s also very important to take care of your mouth and teeth after receiving your new implants and keep them clean and healthy. One of the most important is to keep up with brushing and flossing. Aftercare can help ensure that you don’t have any problems in the future!
