# Are You a Suitable Candidate for Sedation Dentistry?

## What Is Sedation Dentistry?

Sedation dentistry is the administration of drugs before or during the dental procedure to keep the patient calm and free from pain. It's moderate level sedation, which means you're awake and conscious.

Sedation dentistry is also called “twilight sleep” or conscious sedation dentistry because it's accompanied by a short period of [amnesia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amnesia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353360) in which you aren't sensitive to pain but conscious.

## How does Sedation Dentistry Work?

Before sedation dentistry, you have to discuss your health history and the medications or supplements you've been using with your dentist. When all the necessary information is available, you will be given sedation options to consider depending on your specific needs.

Again, you're not supposed to eat or drink anything for no less than six hours before the dental procedure. Unless otherwise stated by the dentist, you can use routine medications.

There are various levels of sedation dentistry, and a single option is selected based on the client's requirements and stability. Other factors that influence the type of sedation dentistry that you can use involve the length of procedure, anxiety levels, health history and comorbidities.

In dentistry, the most common sedations involve the use of nitrous oxide, intravenous sedation and oral conscious sedation.

Nitrous oxide gives a calming effect three to five minutes after inhaling it through a nosepiece or mask. The dentist will have to adjust the dosage and level of sedation accordingly during the procedure. Once the procedure is over, you're given oxygen to flush out the nitrous oxide from the body. Nitrous oxide leaves faster, and you can travel home after the procedure.

Intravenous sedation dentistry is typically the deepest level of conscious sedation. The dentist delivers sedative medication into the bloodstream using an intravenous line. Heart rate, oxygen level and blood pressure are monitored during the procedure. Intravenous sedation dentistry is ideal for people with lengthy procedures or those with dental anxiety.

Oral conscious sedation involves the oral administration of a sedative drug to the client before the procedure. The dentist can use different drugs for oral conscious sedation dentistry, ranging from diazepam to lorazepam.
