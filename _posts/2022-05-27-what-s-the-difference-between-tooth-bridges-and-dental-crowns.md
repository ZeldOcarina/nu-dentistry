title: What's the Difference Between Tooth Bridges and Dental Crowns?

---
Dental crowns and bridges can be confusing. However, here is a clear comparison. [Dental bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(dentistry)) are used to replace one or more missing teeth by anchoring the new teeth to the existing ones. On the other hand, dental crowns cover and restore the already damaged tooth.

In simple terms, the main purpose of a dental bridge is to fill the missing spaces, while a dental crown is used to cover the already existing tooth. The bridge comprises false teeth with a crown on each end. The crown acts as anchors for the missing teeth, allowing the dental bridge to fill the gap effectively.

A dental crown is also called a cap because it restores the tooth structure without extraction or implantation of other teeth. It's typically placed over the damaged tooth and cemented to stay in place.

## What are Crowns and How do They Work?

The crown is the cap that is applied over the damaged tooth. Different materials such as porcelain or metals are used to make the crown. If you have a large tooth cavity that makes tooth filling difficult, you will need to have a [dental crown](https://www.nudentistry.com/houston-tx/restorative-dentistry/tooth-crown/). In addition, if your tooth has cracks, is severely weakened or massively worn down, you need a crown.

Dental crowns work by restoring your teeth's shape, size, appearance, and strength. Once it's cemented in place, it forms a hat over your tooth and hides the previously damaged portions of the tooth.

## What is the Function of Bridges?

Missing teeth affect how you eat, talk and smile. Therefore, if you have a missing tooth, you need to fill the gap using artificial teeth with the aid of a dental bridge. The bridge has a crown on either side to support the false teeth.

People with a missing tooth or teeth use a dental bridge. You can lose one or more teeth due to tooth decay, tooth injury or gum disease.

## What is the process of making a crown?

The dentist will inject an anesthetic agent into the damaged tooth and adjoining [gum ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gums)tissue. Drilling and extracting the damaged part is done to offer enough space for the dental crown.

If the natural teeth don't have enough support, the dentist will create a buildup that offers the appropriate foundation for the crown.

Before the actual day of treatment, the dentist should have used a digital scanner to create an impression of the damaged tooth. The impression is sent to the dental laboratory for the engineers to manufacture the crown. It will take some time to be available, but the dentists might offer you a temporary crown for the period.

After installing the crown, a special cement is used to fix the crown over natural teeth, and the installation process is over.

## How are Bridges Made?

You should visit your dentist at least twice when you've opted to fix the missing teeth using a dental bridge. The first visit is when the dentist will reshape abutment teeth and dentin, then remove damaged areas to create space for the crown.

In addition, during the first visit, the dentist will also take impressions of the affected teeth or use a digital scan to capture the dimensions of your teeth. The results are then sent to the lab for the production of a bridge, false teeth and the crown. A temporary bridge protects exposed areas until the right one is completed.

[The dentist](https://www.nudentistry.com/houston-tx/our-doctors/dr-akers/) will remove the temporary bridge and place the permanent dental bridge on the second visit. A careful assessment is done, and necessary adjustments are made until the bridge fits comfortably in your mouth.

## How Long Do Crowns and Bridges Last?

With proper care and maintenance, dental crowns and bridges last for up to 7 to 10 years.
