## **What is Aesthetic Dentistry?**

[Aesthetic dentistry](https://www.nudentistry.com/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/aesthetic-dentistry/), often called cosmetic dentistry, aims to improve not just the appearance of your teeth, but also of your gums and/or bite. It is primarily used to enhance your smile and mouth shape, which can even extend to enhancing how well your teeth operate in terms of the force and form of your bite. But unlike teeth whitening, this form of dental work is mostly focused on enhancing your tooth's appearance rather than its functionality.

Functional gains are frequently unintended by successful cosmetic dentistry procedures. The following characteristics set it apart from conventional dental, gingival, and oral practices with regard to the health of your teeth, gums and mouth.

* **Focused on Dental Aesthetics:** Aesthetic dentistry primarily aims to improve the appearance of your smile by changing the color, shape, size, placement, and alignment of your teeth. This holds true for healthy gums that can be surgically altered to fix gummy smiles and improve jaw shape. Others opt to employ dentistry that only focuses on enhancing the aesthetics of their teeth, despite some people's contention that dental operations alone can improve both form and function.
* **The duties of aesthetic dentists:** Although this branch of dentistry is officially referred to as aesthetic dentistry, cosmetic dentist is frequently used to refer to practitioners. Despite the fact that this style of dentistry is not regarded as a formal specialization, their specialized work experience, education, training, and expertise are focused on it. Although there are over-the-counter teeth whitening products, a cosmetic dentist is still preferred because these procedures offer the best success rates for whitening discolored teeth.
* **Realities and Controversies of Aesthetic Dentistry:** Concerns about the ethics of the practice surround doctors specializing in cosmetic dentistry or identifying themselves as such because the practice's main goal is to position these individuals as the dental equivalent of a plastic surgeon. In reality, aesthetic dentistry is not a recognized formal specialty by the [American Dental Association](https://www.ada.org/) (ADA).

The following procedures may be performed on your teeth, gums, mouth, and jaw as part of aesthetic dentistry, which also includes prosthodontics and orthodontics (dentures).

* **A Dental Material Addition:** By asking your cosmetic dentist to add dental material to your gums or teeth, you might end up with a megawatt grin that can compete with Tom Cruise's or Brad Pitt's. Gum grafts, porcelain veneers or laminates, crowns or caps, and bonding procedures can all be ordered individually for your teeth and gums.
* **Dental Material Removal:** Your gums may be repositioned to expose more teeth if you have a gummy grin. The same applies if you or your dentist believe that your teeth are overly large. Gingivectomy is the term for gum removal. Enameloplasty refers to the scaling and removal of enamel. Some dental offices offer bonding and tooth contouring at the same appointment.
* **Cosmetic Improvements Without Adding or Removing Anything:** There are aesthetic procedures available that can enhance your smile without modifying your gums, tooth structure, or other dental components. This involves laser [whitening ](https://www.nudentistry.com/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/pro-teeth-whitening/)or bleaching your enamel, gum depigmentation to get the proper gum color, and other procedures.
* **Teeth Alignment to Enhance the Face:** Your teeth should be aligned properly using procedures like braces or retainers, sometimes known as orthodontic dentistry, to correct any overbite, underbite or horse-like teeth. As a result of how significantly your jaw, chin, and cheeks have changed, your face will then look better.
