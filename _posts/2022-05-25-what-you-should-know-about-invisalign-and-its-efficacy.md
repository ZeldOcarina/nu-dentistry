# What is Invisalign?

Invisalign is an [orthodontic treatment](https://www.dentalhealth.org/orthodontic-treatment#:\~:text=Orthodontic%20treatment%20is%20a%20way,pressure%20over%20all%20your%20teeth.) that is used to straighten and realign teeth. It involves a series of custom-made, clear braces that cover the teeth and pull them gently to their right position. Invisalign is less noticeable and easy to remove, unlike the traditional metal braces.

For people who want to improve the quality of their smile and don't want to use traditional metal braces, Invisalign is the best choice. The clear braces feel comfortable in the mouth and make your teeth look beautiful and well-aligned, twice as fast as traditional braces.

## What kinds of dental problems can Invisalign fix?

Invisalign is designed to treat the following orthodontic problems:

**Misaligned Teeth**

Misaligned teeth affect the beauty of your smile. They also pose a lot of challenges when you're eating and chewing. The major causes of teeth misalignment are thumb-sucking and genetic factors. It’s also seen in people with small jaws compared to the teeth size.

Invisalign treats misaligned teeth by exerting pressure on the erupted teeth out of position and bringing them to the right place within the jawline. Treatment of misaligned teeth using an Invisalign usually takes between 6 to 12 months. However, it also depends on the condition of your teeth when the Invisalign is applied.

**Crowded and Crooked Teeth**

Crowded and crooked teeth are different orthodontic problems, but somehow similar. Although they are not serious problems, they significantly impact your lifestyle and self-esteem. It can lower your confidence level and make you feel embraced in front of your friends.

Invisalign treats both crowded and crooked teeth for more than one year. In children, treating crowded and crooked teeth takes less than six months and sometimes 6 to 12 months. Therefore, use Invisalign to treat crowded and crooked teeth in the early life stages.

**Overbite and Underbite**

Overbite is when the upper front teeth overlap with the lower front teeth. On the other hand, Underbite is when the lower front teeth overlap with the upper front teeth. [Invisalign](https://www.nudentistry.com/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/invisalign/) treats Overbite and Underbite permanently within a few months.

**Crossbite and Open bite**

Cross bite is a dental condition involving the inability of upper and lower teeth to meet properly when the mouth is closed. It causes teeth to break down, and painful gum problems can develop later.

Open bite is when the upper and lower teeth don't meet when you close your mouth. Bite problems are also common.

Invisalign treats crossbite and open bite by pushing the teeth back to the correct positions.

## What does it take to put them on?

Children and adults can use Invisalign. The clear braces are used to close wide teeth gaps and treat overbite, underbite, open bite, crossbite, crooked teeth and overcrowded teeth, among other dental problems.
