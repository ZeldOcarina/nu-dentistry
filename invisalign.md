  content: |-
    If you have overcrowded, gapped, or crooked teeth, Invisalign© may be a great choice for you! Nu Dentistry is a certified Invisalign provider and can work with you to create your beautiful smile!
    While many believe that braces are only for teens, Invisalign is the treatment for everyone. Available for tweens, teens, and adults, it is an excellent <a href='/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/aesthetic-dentistry/' target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>cosmetic dentistry option</a> for people who want straight teeth but don't like the look of traditional braces.
    Invisalign has been the top choice in alternatives to traditional orthodontic treatments for a good reason. These clear aligners are virtually invisible, removing the issue of aesthetics when it comes to teeth alignment.
    Instead of using bulky metal brackets and wires, Invisalign's clear aligner trays are custom designed to meet your desired smile goals discreetly. New trays are used approximately every two weeks to move your teeth to their desired position successfully.
    Give us a call today at <a href='tel:+8329164144' title='Click to Call Us'>(832) 916-4144</a> to set up your Invisalign consultation.

  heading: INVISALIGN VS BRACES
  text: HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH IS RIGHT FOR YOU?
  content: 'Clear aligners and braces serve the same purpose and address the same
    problems: crowded or crooked teeth, overjet, over and underbite, and even incorrectly
    aligned jaws. However, their different approaches are about more than just aesthetics.
    Traditional braces, which use materials like metal, porcelain, and plastic, are
    composed of brackets, wiring, and elastic bands that stand out front and center
    on your teeth. Since they''re cemented to your teeth throughout the process, wearers
    have to be careful about their diets and oral hygiene habits. Otherwise, they
    risk damaging their braces. Clear aligners, however, are easily removable, making
    eating and caring for your teeth a breeze in comparison. With traditional orthodontics,
    patients often find it more challenging to keep up with their dental hygiene,
    considering it a hassle. Poor oral hygiene often leads to <a href=''/houston-tx/restorative-dentistry/cavity-fillings/''
    target=''_blank'' class=''paragraph-link''>cavities</a> and other dental issues,
    which can be complicated to treat when maneuvering around their braces. A major
    benefit to clear aligners is their ability to be removed. Invisalign is at its
    most effective when it''s worn at least 22 hours every day. You can remove them,
    so you don''t have to be self-conscious about your smile at special outings or
    while eating with friends and family. However, the more you leave your trays off,
    the more slowly your treatment will progress.'

  heading: CARING FOR YOUR INVISALIGN
  text: KEEPING YOUR ALIGNERS CLEAN MAKES FOR BETTER TEETH
  content: |-
    To take care of your teeth, you also need to take care of your equipment. After all, no jockey enters a horse race without tending to their prized stallion—not if they want to cross the finish line in first place—and the same is true for your clear aligners. They need proper upkeep and maintenance to ensure your path to perfect teeth is quick and straightforward.

    Clean your Invisalign at least once a day. We recommend you do this in the morning to both set a routine for yourself and to make sure you maintain healthy oral hygiene habits. There are a few different methods for cleaning your aligners:

    - **Rinse with water.** Every time you remove your Invisalign, make sure you rinse them with cold water, never hot. Rinsing stops saliva and plaque from building up.
    - **Antibacterial soap.** Gently wash your aligners with soap and water, preferably using a toothbrush. Do not use toothpaste as it can scratch the plastic.
    - **Retainer or denture cleaner.** Mix either a drop or tablet in water, and let your Invisalign soak for 15-20 minutes. Be sure to clear any food or plaque with a toothbrush before soaking.
    - **Cleaning crystals.** Similar to cleaners, you can soak your aligners using approved cleaning crystals mixed with water. Let them sit for 15 minutes before rinsing and returning them to your mouth.

    Each time you take out your clear aligners, don't leave them out to collect bacteria and germs. Put them in your aligner case until you're ready to wear them again. We also recommend that you brush and floss before putting your Invisalign back in to keep both your teeth and your aligners in peak condition.

  faqs:
  - heading: HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR INVISALIGN?
    content: In many cases, Invisalign works faster than traditional braces. The complexity
      of your specific dental situation can greatly determine your treatment length,
      but the average time is 12 to 18 months. However, some patients have been able
      to correct their teeth alignment in as little as 6 months.
  - heading: IS INVISALIGN AS GOOD AS BRACES?
    content: Invisalign holds its mettle against braces, though they each have their
      advantages over the other. For Invisalign, the invisible braces not only straighten
      your teeth but are also much more comfortable to wear without needing to change
      your lifestyle. However, there are some cases for which Invisalign is not appropriate
      and traditional braces must be used.
  - heading: WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T WEAR MY INVISALIGN FOR 22 HOURS A DAY?
    content: When you remove them, rinse them in cold water before cleaning them with
      antibacterial soap. Do not use hot water or toothpaste when washing as these
      can damage your aligners. As an alternative, you can also soak them in retainer
      cleaner for 15-20 minutes. Once clean, rinse your aligners and pop them back
      in your mouth, good as new.
  - heading: CAN CLEAR ALIGNERS FIX OVERBITE?
    content: Absolutely! Clear aligners shift teeth to their proper placement, both
      sideways and upwards. While correcting your overbite, they also have the advantage
      of moving the gums with your teeth, meaning you won’t have to worry about losing
      the proportions of your smile.
  - heading: HOW SHOULD I CLEAN MY CLEAR ALIGNERS?
    content: When you remove them, rinse them in cold water before cleaning them with
      antibacterial soap. Do not use hot water or toothpaste when washing as these
      can damage your aligners. As an alternative, you can also soak them in retainer
      cleaner for 15-20 minutes. Once clean, rinse your aligners and pop them back
      in your mouth, good as new.
  - heading: HOW MUCH DOES INVISALIGN COST?
    content: Invisalign and other clear braces often have a similar cost to that of
      traditional braces. Price is determined by the length of the treatment needed.
      Nu Dentistry is determined to make sure you receive the treatment you deserve
      in a manner you can afford. We're prepared to work with you to find a <a href='/dental-financing/'
      target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>payment plan</a> that is comfortable
      for you.
  - heading: IS EARLY ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT NECESSARY?
    content: If your orthodontist says that your child needs braces, then you should
      listen. Early detection and treatment before your child's adult teeth fully
      come in can prevent future problems and save you time and money.
  - heading: DO CLEAR ALIGNERS REALLY WORK?
    content: Yes! Clear aligners have been helping people straighten their teeth since
      1997. Over 3 million dental patients across 2 decades have proven that they
      not only look good but are super effective. You'll be amazed by your Invisalign
      before and after!
  - heading: ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS FOR STRAIGHTENING MY TEETH BESIDES BRACES?
    content: We understand that not everyone wants to wait to enjoy straight teeth.
      For those patients, we offer veneers. This cosmetic dentistry service involves
      bonding a thin porcelain veneer to your existing tooth to change its appearance
      to exactly how you want it. Veneers can not only straighten crooked teeth but
      whiten and lengthen them too.
