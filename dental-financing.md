  heading: CARE CREDIT DENTAL FINANCING
  text: WHEN DENTAL INSURANCE JUST ISN’T ENOUGH, PAYING FOR THE TREATMENTS YOU NEED
    CAN BE MADE SIMPLE WITH A CARE CREDIT CARD
  content: |-
    Care Credit allows you to cover the full amount of your dental visit on their service credit card. You then make payments in manageable monthly installments. There’s no expiration date on your Care Credit account, so you can continue to get the treatments you need without the added stress of waiting for approval again.

    Care Credit is also a great option for patients who DO have dental insurance. We all know that insurance providers don’t always cover the full amounts, and the copayments they leave behind can still be a shock. As a dentist that takes Care Credit, however, you can charge the total copayment with us on your Care Credit card without having to rush to the bank.

    Not sure how to apply for Care Credit dental? Don’t worry. The entire process is super simple. All you have to do is follow their intuitive instructions online, and your dental care credit card will be on its way as soon as your application is approved. You’ll be able to start using your account with Care Credit dental providers, including us at Nu Dentistry, right away! Care Credit can be used even before the card arrives!

  heading: OUR IN-HOUSE DENTAL FINANCING OPTIONS
  text: TAKING THE STRESS OUT OF HOW TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT YOU NEED
  content: At Nu Dentistry, we understand that financing dental work can be stressful,
    regardless of whether you have dental insurance. That’s why our team is fully
    prepared to put together a program that’s right for you. As health providers dedicated
    to your total satisfaction, we want you to always get the care you need without
    having to break the bank. How exactly do in-house payment plans work? Our dentists
    know the ins and outs of our treatments, and we know just how to break them down
    into their most basic parts and costs. After an initial down payment, usually
    between 30 to 40% of the total payment cost, you can gradually pay the rest back
    in small, affordable installments until your procedure is fully covered. In-house
    financing is a great option for those without dental insurance or if the insurance
    they have doesn’t cover the total cost. Our Houston office is flexible because
    we believe that everyone should have access to amazing dental care, no matter
    their financial situation. If you have any questions or concerns about our payment
    programs, don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href='tel:+8329164144' title='Click
    to Call Us'>(832) 916-4144</a>. We’re always happy to discuss your financial options
    and make things that little bit easier for you.

  faqs:
  - heading: WHAT IS DENTAL IN HOUSE FINANCING?
    content: Dental in-house financing is a way for you to figure out your financing
      structure directly with us at Nu Dentistry. Unlike using dental insurance coverage
      or charging your treatment bill to your credit card, you can access our office’s
      unique terms, down payment options, and interest for each of our services. Our
      dentists are experts at what we do and know how to break down each part of the
      treatment process, meaning we know exactly how to shift things in your favor.
      For example, if you’re having trouble with your <a href='/houston-tx/restorative-dentistry/dental-implants/'
      target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>dental implant</a> financing, you can
      work with your periodontist to put together a payment plan that works for everyone!
  - heading: 'WHICH IS BETTER: DENTAL INSURANCE OR DENTAL DISCOUNT PLAN?'
    content: While your dental insurance can cover quite a bit of your dental bill
      each year, dental discounts aren’t something to scoff at either. While no one
      is paying for your treatment but you, the amount of money you can save from
      discounts can be well over the amount you pay for your premium with an insurance
      provider. This is especially true if you end up needing multiple treatments
      done throughout the year.
  - heading: WHAT CREDIT SCORE DO I NEED TO GET APPROVED FOR CARE CREDIT?
    content: You’re much more likely to be approved for Care Credit if you have a
      credit score of 623 or higher. However, it’s not impossible to get their dental
      care credit card if you have lesser credit. There have been cases where patients
      have been approved with scores as low as 600.
  - heading: Do dentists let you pay in installments?
    content: Not all dentists let you pay in installments, but at Nu Dentistry, we’re
      dedicated to ensuring our dental financing for patients is affordable. Talk
      to your treatment coordinator about spreading out the cost of your treatment.
  - heading: CAN I GET DENTAL FINANCE WITH BAD CREDIT?
    content: Getting the financial help you need with bad credit depends on the dental
      financing options you’re looking at. Insurance providers tend to love patients
      with great credit. Care Credit is much more lenient and focuses on people with
      more mediocre credit scores. When you have a score that’s less than stellar,
      your best choice is to work directly with us at Nu Dentistry. In addition to
      potential dental discounts, we can also help you make your payment plan more
      affordable with in-house financing and installments.
  - heading: Do you have to pay for dental work up front?
    content: If you don’t have dental insurance or if your plan doesn’t cover the
      full amount of your treatment, there’s no reason to panic over figuring out
      how to make up the difference up front. Our office is ready to work with you
      to come up with an in-house payment plan to pay the rest in installments. All
      you’ll need is a simple downpayment to start, and we’ll space out the other
      payments to ensure you’re able to make the full amount without any stress or
      worry.
