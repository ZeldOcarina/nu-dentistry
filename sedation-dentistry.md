    heading: STAY ANXIETY-FREE WITH SEDATION DENTISTRY IN HOUSTON
    text: NEVER MISS A DENTIST APPOINTMENT AGAIN BECAUSE OF DENTAL ANXIETY!
    content: |-
      Poor hygiene habits and poor diets are the most common culprits for cavities and decay. However, there is a secret villain causing toothaches and oral problems around the world: dental phobia. Fear of the dentist has led too many patients to avoid their dental cleanings and exams — a big and costly mistake. Avoiding the dentist can lead to dental problems that otherwise would have been easily treatable. However, our dentists are here to help you conquer your fear and make visits to our office simple and painless.

      Here at Nu Dentistry, we want to make sure you're always entirely at ease when receiving the care you need. For those who want more than general anesthesia to feel reassured about their treatment, we offer a wide selection of both conscious and unconscious sedation options available upon request. We always want our patients to have the best dental experience possible. Let our dental team ease your fears in our calm and safe dental office. Going to the dental office without fear will completely change your life and get your dental health back on track. 

      If you have any questions or concerns about sleep dentistry, call our office at (832) 916-4144, and we'll be happy to answer.

    - heading: NITROUS OXIDE
      copy: |-
        Nitrous Oxide, or more commonly known as "laughing gas," is a colorless, sweet-smelling gas administered through a mask to help patients of all needs and ages relax. It has a euphoric effect and will not put you to sleep. This option is great for patients who are nervous during dental cleaning appointments.

    - heading: ORAL SEDATION
      copy: 
        Oral Sedation, which is mildly stronger than laughing gas, is administered in pill form. Your pill should be taken around an hour before treatment so that it fully kicks in during your procedure. Oral sedation is a conscious sedation method. However, it may make you feel tired and relaxed enough to fall asleep naturally in the dental chair. You will be able to communicate with your sedation dentist, though you may not remember much of your treatment.

    - heading: IV SEDATION
      copy: |-
        Patients with extreme dental fear or anxiety often select this option. IV Sedation is also an excellent option for those who would like multiple procedures performed in a single day, such as multiple extractions, implants, or root canals. It is given intravenously to offer a maximum level of relaxation. There are two levels of IV sedation: "twilight" and "deep" sedation. Twilight sedation leaves patients awake, though somewhat loopy, and likely to fall asleep. Deep sedation is a form of unconscious sedation.

    heading: SAME-DAY DENTAL PROCEDURES
    text: WE MAKE SURE YOU NEVER HAVE TO WAIT TO GET THE TREATMENT YOU NEED.
    content: |-
      Major dental procedures can take a lot of time to complete. When multiple treatments are needed, it can take way too much time to get them done separately. However, sedation dentistry allows you to comfortably get a brand new smile in a single visit with same-day dental procedures.

      Oral sedation allows you to stay awake and puts your mind at ease throughout your procedures. For patients who prefer it, we can use IV sedation to keep you asleep throughout your procedures. Your time with us will be over before you know it! Our sedation dentists can help you decide which method is right for your needs.

      Save yourself time and discomfort by having most of your procedures finished in a single appointment! With sedation dentistry, we can make your time in our office as efficient as possible without putting a strain on your daily life. If you're ready to schedule your treatments, call our office at **(832) 916-4144** today!

    faqs:
      - heading: WHAT IS SEDATION DENTISTRY, AND IS IT DANGEROUS?
        content:
          Sedation dentistry is the use of medications, administered orally, by gas, or through IV to relax patients and remove discomfort during treatment. It is often used for people with acute dental anxiety and during intensive procedures, such as tooth extractions and implants. All of our sedation dentists are trained to use sedation safely. We always check your history to ensure that sedation is the right choice for you before moving forward.
      - heading: HOW MUCH DOES SEDATION DENTISTRY COST?
        content:
          The cost of sedation is dependent upon several factors, including which type will be used and for how long. IV sedation, for example, is priced at an hourly rate while others are only a flat fee.
      - heading: WHAT HELPS WITH DENTAL ANXIETY?
        content:
          We have many different dental anxiety treatment options available at Nu Dentistry. We have sedation options that ease your mind and body. We have also put time and effort into making sure our office is peaceful and relaxing. Each suite is outfitted with televisions and wireless headphones to help put you in the right mental headspace to forget your treatment and relax.
      - heading: WHAT CAN I EXPECT AFTER SEDATION DENTISTRY?
        content:
          After your procedure has finished, your sedation dentist will let you go home. However, you will not be able to drive yourself or operate any other machinery for at least 12 hours. Expect your coordination, perception, judgment, and memory to be skewed. We recommend that you stay at home until the effects fully pass, usually by the end of the day.
      - heading: WHAT DOES CONSCIOUS SEDATION FEEL LIKE?
        content:
          While this varies from patient to patient, and the strength of the sedation method, most people feel drowsy or relaxed as their stress and anxiety melt away. You might also experience a tingling or heaviness throughout your body. With nitrous oxide, you might start smiling or laughing for no particular reason.
      - heading: CAN YOU DRIVE AFTER BEING GIVEN LAUGHING GAS AT THE DENTIST?
        content:
          Laughing gas is the weakest form of sedation. While it may put you in a dreamlike, euphoric state, it wears off within minutes, and you return quickly to lucidity without any adverse effects or drowsiness. By the time you leave our office, you'll be perfectly safe to drive yourself home or to work.
