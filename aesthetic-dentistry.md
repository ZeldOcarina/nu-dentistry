  heading: REPAIR AND RESTORE WITH TOOTH BONDING
  text: TRUST US TO MAKE YOUR WORN AND CHIPPED TEETH RETURN TO THEIR NATURAL STATE
  content: |-
    For less drastic changes than veneers or crowns, we can also fix your smile with the help of tooth bonding. With this quick, cost-efficient procedure, we use composite resin to repair decayed, chipped, fractured, and even discolored teeth. Tooth bonding is an extremely versatile cosmetic dentistry option. It can be used to lengthen short teeth, close unwanted gaps, and change a tooth's shape. The same resin is also used for <a href='/houston-tx/restorative-dentistry/cavity-fillings/' target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>tooth-colored fillings</a>.

    There's no end to the possibilities when you put your trust in us. Tooth bonding is the fast, hassle-free solution to perfecting your teeth. The process is completely noninvasive, meaning you won't need any anesthetic. Our skilled dentists can trim and shape your smile to exactly how you want it. Within half an hour to an hour, you can restore your teeth to their natural beauty. Ready to book your appointment? Call our office at <a href='tel:+8329164144' title='Click to Call Us'>(832) 916-4144</a> for your consultation.

  heading: BRING OUT THE NEW YOU WITH VENEERS
  text: YOUR COSMETIC DENTIST WILL HELP YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR SMILE
  content: Do you know precisely what your smile should look like, but your teeth
    never listen? We can help you bring your vision to life with <a href='/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/porcelain-veneers/'
    target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>veneers</a>! Veneers are thin, 0.5mm thick
    porcelain or ceramic tooth facades which layer over your existing teeth to make
    them look impeccable. They're highly versatile, able to correct chipped, crooked,
    worn down, stained, unshapely, and uneven teeth. With proper dental upkeep and
    eating habits, yours can last 10 to 15 years. We're artists when it comes to your
    new teeth. Whether you're looking to improve one or a dozen teeth, we're experts
    at color matching your veneers. From dazzling, Hollywood-white, or a more charming,
    natural shade, our cosmetic dentists will listen to what you need to stand out
    and stand confident with your upgraded smile. We want your veneers to not only
    look like your real teeth but feel like them too. To keep your veneers from feeling
    bulky or noticeable in your mouth, the process will involve shaving your existing
    teeth down so that your cosmetic treatment fits like a glove.

  heading: PERFECT YOUR SMILE WITH INVISALIGN
  text: WE ALIGN EVERYTHING FOR YOU EFFORTLESSLY, SO YOU’RE ALWAYS SATISFIED
  content: |-
    Are you tired of crooked and misaligned teeth but don't want to deal with the look and restrictions of traditional braces? Then it's time you look into Invisalign, our first choice for clear aligners. Invisalign removes the aesthetic concerns of braces without losing the effectiveness. It corrects crooked and crowded teeth, gaps, over and underbites, improperly aligned jaws, and angled teeth known as overjet just as well as its metal counterpart without any of the frustrating brackets, wiring, and elastics. A series of clear plastic trays custom fit to your mouth is created. These trays align your teeth more gradually than traditional braces, easing the strain of your shifting teeth. Patients exchange for their next, tighter Invisalign tray every one or two weeks and start seeing results in a matter of weeks. Depending on the unique factors of your case, you can leave our office with an impeccable smile in as little as six months. A fantastic advantage with clear aligners is that they only need to be worn 22 hours a day.

    You can remove them for meals and cleaning, meaning you don't have to adjust your lifestyle to get the results you want. Popcorn, apples, and bubblegum are no problem with Invisalign! Whether you're a child, a teen, or an adult, you deserve a smile you can't stop showing off. Here at Nu Dentistry, our dentists are eager to make your transition to flawless teeth go without a hitch. Call (832) 916-4144 to schedule your consultation appointment.

  faqs:
  - heading: CAN A GENERAL DENTIST DO COSMETIC DENTISTRY?
    content: A general dentist and a cosmetic dentist have the same base education.
      They often perform many of the same procedures, including cosmetic dentistry.
      General dentists are just as qualified as specialists, and have often completed
      additional training to treat your smile with the same level of care.
  - heading: CAN YOU REALLY GET NEW TEETH IN ONE DAY?
    content: Some cosmetic dentistry options can take weeks from your first consultation.
      However, others, such as teeth whitening and bonding, can take as little time
      as a single visit.
  - heading: DO VENEERS RUIN YOUR TEETH?
    content: While there may be the saying 'beauty is pain,' that's not at all true
      when it comes to veneers. Not only do they not ruin your teeth, but porcelain
      veneers are long-lasting, stain-resistant, and harder to damage than your regular
      teeth!
  - heading: DOES BONDING LOOK NATURAL?
    content: Our dentists match the shade of the composite resin used to the shade
      of your tooth. Your teeth will look as good as new after your tooth bonding.
      The resin used blends smoothly with your existing enamel to make it hard for
      even your dentist to see it.
  - heading: CAN YOU GET VENEERS WITHOUT SHAVING YOUR TEETH?
    content: Most porcelain and resin veneers require shaving your teeth down. However,
      there are certain types of veneers, such as Lumineers, that are thin enough
      to fit over your teeth without any preparation. If you're ready for your own
      no-prep veneers, contact our office for a consultation.
  - heading: WHAT IS THE BEST COLOR FOR VENEERS?
    content: When it comes to choosing the color for your veneers, we always make
      sure that your teeth look as natural as possible. We color match seamlessly
      and discuss your options so that you're always happy with your bright, new smile.
  - heading: IS GUM CONTOURING PAINFUL?
    content: Removing excess gum tissue or restoring a receding gum line can be done
      comfortably. Our safe anesthetic and sedation options guarantee that the entire
      contouring process will be painless. Nu Dentistry is dedicated to your full
      comfort, and we're prepared to help you if any of the process makes you nervous.
  - heading: WHAT ARE DENTAL IMPLANTS?
    content: A dental implant is an artificial tooth—root, crown, and all—that is
      surgically attached to your jaw to replace a missing tooth and prevent the jawbone
      from deteriorating. It consists of a metal post called an implant, a porcelain
      crown to act as the tooth, and an abutment to connect the two.
  - heading: Thank you! Your form has been submitted!
    content: In-office teeth whitening is actually the most effective way to brighten
      your teeth. Here at Nu Dentistry, we use the Beyond whitening system, both in
      the dental chair and with our custom take-home trays. This system whitens brighter
      and lasts longer than over the counter strips, and the process itself is quicker!
