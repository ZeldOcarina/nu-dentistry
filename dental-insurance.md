  heading: PPO DENTAL INSURANCE
  text: WE ACCEPT ALL PPO INSURANCE PLANS TO ENSURE YOU RECEIVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL
    OF FLEXIBILITY AND CHOICE IN YOUR DENTAL TREATMENTS.
  content: |-
    Here at Nu Dentistry, we accept all Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) dental insurance plans. PPO insurance gives you a wide selection of treatments and dental offices like us to choose from without having to worry about primary care providers, referrals to specialists, or dental emergencies during vacations and travel. Popular providers of dental PPO insurance include Cigna, United Healthcare, Ameritas, Humana, and Delta Dental Insurance. There are standard costs and levels of coverage with each plan.

    It’s important when choosing your provider to look into their specific treatment coverage, monthly premiums, annual limits, and out-of-pocket minimum. PPO insurance is the most popular of all types of dental insurance due to the level of flexibility it allows you and your family. Other types of plans, such as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) insurance, don’t have as broad of a network. They also require you to have a primary dental care provider who you must receive referrals from for treatments they can’t provide in-house.

  heading: TREATMENTS COVERED BY INSURANCE
  text: WHEN SCHEDULING A TREATMENT, YOU'LL WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS AND ISN'T COVERED
    BY YOUR INSURANCE PROVIDER.
  content: |-
    When you come in for your dental procedures, whether or not they're an emergency, it's important that you have an idea of what kind of coverage you have. Dental PPOs typically cover more services and at a lower deductible. However, even with a PPO plan, most services are not fully covered, and some are not covered at all.

    Most PPO dental insurance plans cover all or some of these treatments:

    - Preventative dentistry, such as twice-yearly general dental exams and routine cleanings
    - Basic treatments, including cavity fillings, root canals, and dental extractions
    - Major treatments, like dental bridges, and crowns

    Your PPO dental insurance provider will most likely cover the full cost of your preventative visits as well as anywhere between 80 to 100% of fillings and other basic procedures. Major procedures are often only half covered, meaning you'll have to make up the rest of the copayment yourself.

    Besides basic insurance plans, there are full coverage dental insurance programs that can also cover:

    - Major tooth restorations including dental implants and dentures
    - Orthodontics, like braces and Invisalign
    - Treatments for pre-existing dental health conditions

    Even with full coverage, however, it is rare for an insurance provider to cover nonessential treatments like cosmetic dentistry procedures. It's also important to note that "full coverage" only applies to the types of treatments available, not the actual cost of your procedure. Just as your basic coverage doesn't cover the total cost, neither will your more expansive plan. If you have any questions about your plans treatment coverage, please contact your insurance provider directly.

  faqs:
  - heading: DOES YOUR DENTAL OFFICE ACCEPT PPO INSURANCE?
    content: Yes! We accept all PPO dental insurance, from Delta Dental to Cigna Dental
      Insurance. At Nu Dentistry, we want to make sure that you get the proper coverage
      you deserve for the dental treatments you need.
  - heading: WHAT IS THE BEST KIND OF DENTAL INSURANCE?
    content: When deciding on the best dental insurance plan, you need to look into
      what’s best for you and your family. You should consider the costs of your policy,
      the treatments covered, and how much of those treatments will be covered. The
      dental network of your favorite dentists is also a huge deciding factor. Unless
      you want to spend time trying to find another amazing dentist you trust, you
      should make sure that your dentist supports and accepts your plan.
  - heading: WHAT DO I DO IF I DON’T HAVE DENTAL INSURANCE?
    content: If you don’t have dental insurance, we also have <a href='/dental-financing/'
      target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>alternative financing options</a> that
      can help ease the stress of paying for your dental treatments. Some of your
      choices include CareCredit financing, in-house financing programs, and our discount
      dental plans on certain services. If you have any questions about these options,
      don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href='tel:+8329164144' title='Click to Call
      Us'>(832) 916-4144</a>, and we’ll happily help you find the option that work
      best for you.
  - heading: WHAT IF MY EMPLOYER DOES NOT OFFER DENTAL INSURANCE?
    content: If your employer doesn’t offer dental insurance, you don’t have to resign
      yourself to uncovered dental procedures. You can purchase your own plan through
      a state health insurance marketplace or a private exchange. You can find an
      affordable dental insurance plan that fully meets your individual needs. Options
      include dental implant insurance, dental insurance for seniors, and even full
      coverage dental insurance.
  - heading: WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR WHEN GETTING DENTAL INSURANCE?
    content: When looking for a great and affordable dental insurance provider, you
      must consider several factors. What do you expect each member of your family
      will need? If you know that your child will need braces or that someone in your
      family will need to replace a missing tooth, make sure that you find dental
      insurance that covers implants, <a href='/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/invisalign/'
      target='_blank' class='paragraph-link'>orthodontic treatment</a>, or any other
      expected dental treatments. When looking at costs, you may be tempted to look
      solely at premium prices. However, you should consider all costs—deductibles,
      maximum annual limits, and out of pocket expenses.
  - heading: WHY IS PPO INSURANCE BETTER THAN HMO INSURANCE?
    content: PPO insurance often has higher premiums than Health Maintenance Organization
      (HMO) plans. However, there’s more to choosing your plan than how much is dental
      insurance. PPO is the best dental insurance option because its coverage is much
      broader. It covers more treatments and procedures and has a wider network of
      dentists to choose from. This means that if you need any specialist treatment
      not offered in-house, you can get the treatment you need without a referral
      from your primary dentist.
