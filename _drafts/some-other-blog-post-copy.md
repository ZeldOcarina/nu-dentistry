Cosmetic dental procedures have come a long way. The days of metal braces and rubber bands are behind us, as cosmetic dentistry offers many more options for those who want to improve the look, feel, and function of their smile. Cosmetic dentists offer everything from teeth whitening services to dental implants that can restore your natural smile without any gaps in between your teeth. If you’re interested in cosmetic dentistry, read on for some tips and tricks about what you need to know!

## What is cosmetic dentistry?

Cosmetic dentistry is a relatively new branch of dental science that focuses on using the latest techniques and materials to change your smile. Using cosmetic procedures, you can improve the appearance of your teeth by getting rid of stains, making them whiter or straighter, and improving their overall shape.

[Cosmetic dental procedures](http://50.18.194.110:40030/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/aesthetic-dentistry/ "Click to jump to our aesthetic dentistry page") are usually performed in an office setting, so they don’t take very long at all! You can get a beautiful new smile without going under general anesthesia or needing any type of surgery! The best part about cosmetic dentistry? It’s not just for people who have been unhappy with their smiles for years—it’s also for young adults who want to look good when they go out into the world.

The benefits of cosmetic dentistry are vast and varied. Cosmetic dentists can help you achieve a more confident smile. They can fix your teeth so that they look their best, and sometimes they may even be able to improve the function of your bite.

## What does cosmetic dentistry include?

Cosmetic dentistry is a branch of dentistry that includes tooth whitening, crowns, [veneers](http://50.18.194.110:40030/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/porcelain-veneers/ "Click to jump to our porcelain veneers page"), and other cosmetic dental procedures to make teeth look better. These procedures are used to improve the appearance of your smile. There are many different types of cosmetic dental treatments available for you to choose from!

A cosmetic dentist is a professional who focuses on many facets of dentistry. Some people think that cosmetic dentists just do teeth whitening, but this isn’t the case! Cosmetic dentists can help with everything from crooked teeth to missing teeth and anything in between. In fact, it’s possible for a cosmetic dentist to even reconstruct someone’s entire mouth!

## What are the benefits of cosmetic dentistry?

Cosmetic dentistry is any procedure that enhances the look or feel of a person’s teeth, gums, or bite. [Cosmetic dental procedures](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/dental-visits/five-types-of-cosmetic-dentistry-procedures) are often performed to improve the patient’s appearance when they smile, but can also be performed for purely functional reasons such as straightening crooked teeth or correcting bites, so patients feel confident when talking and eating.

A great alternative to metal braces is cosmetic dentistry! Additionally, cosmetic procedures can make your teeth look natural while improving their aesthetics. You can improve your smile with cosmetic dentistry in one or two appointments, while [braces](http://50.18.194.110:40030/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/invisalign/ "Click to jump to our Invisalign page") require several months or years!

Cosmetic dental procedures usually cost more than regular dental care because they require additional time in the chair and use materials like porcelain veneers, crowns, and bonding which are considered “high-end” treatments. However, these kinds of cosmetic dental care options can help you achieve a healthier mouth by getting rid of gaps between your teeth, repairing broken-down fillings, or covering stains with veneers. Cosmetic dentistry can also help you improve the function of your teeth by correcting overbites, underbites, and other malocclusions.

The goal of cosmetic dentistry is to make your teeth appear as natural and healthy as possible. To improve the appearance of your smile, cosmetic dentists utilize fillings made of tooth-colored material, porcelain veneers, dental crowns, and other techniques.
