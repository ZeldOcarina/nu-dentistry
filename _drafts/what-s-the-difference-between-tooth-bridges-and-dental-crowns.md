title: What's the Difference Between Tooth Bridges and Dental Crowns?

---
As dentists who take pride in our work, there’s nothing we love more than to have our patients leave with a beaming smile they’re excited to show off to the world. We understand the power of cosmetic dentistry, and we always use it to our Houston patients’ best advantage. From bonding and veneers to professional whitening, we can tackle a wide variety of aesthetic problems to give you a red carpet-worthy smile you adore.

Perfecting crooked teeth and misaligned bites is no exception. While dental braces are what most people think of as their only orthodontic solution, our dentists have another, better option. Invisalign has been sweeping the world by storm since their invention over two decades ago, and it’s not hard to see why. They’re incredibly comfortable, sleek, and convenient, allowing patients of all ages to get the cosmetic care they need without the drawback of clunky metal brackets and “brace-face.”

### What Does An Invisalign Do?

[Invisalign treatment](https://www.nudentistry.com/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/invisalign/) consists of a series of clear plastic aligning trays crafted from molds of your mouth. By switching to the next aligner every two weeks, you’ll be able to gradually and painlessly shift your teeth into the perfect positions. While clear aligners don’t brackets and wires like traditional braces do, that doesn’t mean they aren’t just as capable of getting the job done. Invisalign can fix a wide variety of orthodontic issues:

* Crooked teeth
* Overcrowding
* Gaps between teeth
* Overbite
* Underbite
* Crossbite
* Open bite

After your teeth and bite are precisely where your Invisalign dentist wants, you will need to wear a retainer 24/7 for the next few months to a year just as you would with braces. This allows us to stabilize your alignment and prevent your teeth from sliding back to their old positions. Once we’re sure your smile is steady, you can cut down on the hours you need to wear your retainer. A few nights a week is often enough for most patients, but your dentist will be able to give you an exact timeline.

### Are Clear Aligners Better Than Braces?

For slight to moderate orthodontic problems, the clear answer is easy for the Invisalign vs braces question. Invisalign treatment is better overall than traditional orthodontic braces, from its speedy process to your experience. Here are some of the unique advantages Invisalign has over braces:

##### They are almost unnoticeable.

Invisalign is the invisible braces of the orthodontic world. While “clear braces” made of ceramic might mask dental brackets, clear aligners are the only way to hide your treatment from others completely. Without bulky and colorful brackets on full display on your teeth’s fronts, your transparent aligner trays go unnoticed by everyone around you.

Just make sure to watch what you drink. While most patients remember to take out their clear aligners for meals, some don’t always do the same for drinks. If you’re wearing Invisalign, please avoid dark and colorful beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine. They can stain and discolor your trays just like they do your teeth.

##### Clear aligners are more comfortable than bracket braces.

Invisalign is designed to fit your smile perfectly, sliding smoothly over your teeth without any effort or discomfort. There are no bulky brackets and wires that can poke and rub painfully against the inside of your mouth. Clear aligners also move your teeth more gradually than braces, removing initial discomfort and soreness while adapting to Invisalign.

##### Invisalign is easy to remove.

Unlike bracket braces, Invisalign isn’t permanently bonded to your teeth but can be readily removed whenever you need to. There’s no need to worry about your diet or dental hygiene habits. By taking your aligner trays out when eating, there are no unwanted food restrictions to prevent you from breaking your invisible braces. You also won’t need to learn any new techniques to keep your teeth bright and healthy.

Plus, you don’t need to wear Invisalign 24 hours a day like bracket braces. Only 22 consecutive hours are required to experience the full benefits and amazing results of orthodontic treatment. So if you have any special events planned, you can remove your Invisalign before heading out for your night on the town.

##### You'll see faster results.

While braces can take as long as 3 years to perfect your smile, Invisalign only needs an average of 12 to 18 months. Some of our patients with less severe issues only require their clear aligners for s6 months before walking away with a brand new smile. You’ll also save more time throughout your procedure by requiring fewer trips to your Houston orthodontist for adjustments.

### What Is The Best Age For Orthodontic Treatment?

There is a rule of thumb that the earlier you come in to see an orthodontist, the better, but the best age to straighten your teeth is between ages 8 and 14. At this point, your jaw is still growing and changing, and your adult teeth are steadily replacing your baby ones. This allows your Invisalign dentist to quickly apply a gentle pressure to your teeth as we fine-tune your smile’s development. Most children have an[initial examination and consultation](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/cosmetic-dentistry/early-orthodontics/first-pediatric-orthodontist-visit-what-to-expect-0113) around 6 or 7 years old to determine if orthodontics is necessary. We’ll move forward from there.

There are two main stages for children and teens based on how early their orthodontist needs to start treatment. Phase 1 usually occurs between ages 8 and 10 while baby teeth are still falling out and adult ones are coming in. Phase 1 Invisalign allows us to prepare a child’s smile for all of their emerging permanent teeth to come in without issue. While not all patients require Phase 1 treatment, every orthodontic patient 11 years and older needs Phase 2. During this last stage, our dentists will focus on getting your teeth into their final positions.

Many of our adult patients ask our Houston dentists, “Is it too late to straighten my teeth?” Even if you miss that early window to get clear aligners, you haven’t lost your chance at having the dream smile you’ve always wanted. You’ll still achieve that Invisalign before and after you want—it will just take longer. Your teeth will need a bit more force to move them where we want, and we’ll want to take things a little slower to prevent any discomfort or damage to your teeth.

### Is Invisalign Worth The Money?

As they have become more popular and affordable with time, Invisalign treatment now costs about the same as traditional dental braces. Several factors determine the exact price of your orthodontic work: your oral health needs, if Phase 1 treatment is necessary, the severity of your alignment issues, who you see, and where you go. Most patients agree that Invisalign is well worth the cost. With clear aligners, you can enjoy the long list of benefits our patients love about having straight teeth:

Better Dental Hygiene: without crooked and crowded teeth getting in the way of each other, you’ll be able to brush and floss your teeth much more comfortably and efficiently. Say goodbye to those pesky cavities and gum disease for good! Clearer Speech: misaligned teeth and bites can cause speech impediments and problems that can be solved with orthodontics. No More Neck Pain and Headaches: jaw misalignment can put an undue amount of stress and pain, often leading to chronic headaches and neck pain. Healthy, Whole Smile: straighter teeth lead to less wear and tear on your enamel, and they prevent chips and cracks from forming as easily. Beautiful Smile, Boosted Confidence: with an improved smile, our patients find their self-esteem improves as they can’t help themselves from showing off their pearly white grins.

If you’re concerned about the price of your orthodontic treatment, many dental insurance plans also cover at least part of your Invisalign cost. Here at Nu Dentistry, we accept all PPO dental insurance plans to allow our patients flexibility in getting affordable dental care. However, we understand that insurance rarely takes care of the total cost of any treatment. Our Houston dental office offers multiple [financing options](https://www.nudentistry.com/dental-financing/) to ensure you never have to worry about putting off a procedure you need.
