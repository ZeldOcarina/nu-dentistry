  heading: DENTAL BONDING VS. VENEERS
  text: WE WANT YOU TO PERFECT YOUR SMILE ON YOUR TERMS
  content: |-
    There are many ways that you can get the smile makeover you always wanted. At Nu Dentistry, we want to make sure that you always go into your dental decisions well-informed and excited. When it comes to quick, [tooth transforming cosmetic dentistry](http://50.18.194.110:40030/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/aesthetic-dentistry/), you have to decide which is better: dental bonding or veneers? Dental bonding uses a composite, tooth-colored resin that is applied directly to your tooth and molded to fit your specific needs.

    It can still address the same problems as veneers: chipped or cracked teeth, gaps between teeth, short teeth, misalignment, and tooth shape. Dentists also use bonding resin as a natural-looking alternative to amalgam fillings. There is no preparation needed for bonding, and your entire treatment can be completed in a single office visit. In as little as 30 minutes to an hour, you can have your new smile at a lower price. However, dental veneers can outlast bonding by years.

    Veneers, particularly porcelain ones, are made of much sturdier material, resisting stains and damage that bonding can’t. They also cover the entire tooth, allowing for more drastic cosmetic changes to be possible. If you’re looking for a quick, easy smile transformation, call us now at (832) 916-4144 to make an appointment. Our team can help you decide which option is the right choice for you.

  faqs:
  - heading: HOW MUCH DO DENTAL VENEERS COST?
    content: The price of your veneers can vary depending on which type you’re going
      to have. No-prep veneers, which are thin enough to fit over your teeth without
      shaving them down, tend to be more affordable. Porcelain veneers tend to cost
      a bit more since they require preparing your teeth, and they can last 2 to 3
      times longer. However, regardless of which kind you get, most veneers are not
      covered by insurance.
  - heading: HOW DO YOU GET A BEAUTIFUL SMILE AT THE DENTIST?
    content: 'There are two main ways you can get the smile of your dreams at the
      dentist: by incredible dental hygiene or through cosmetic dentistry. Brushing
      your teeth and making regular cleaning appointments can only do so much, however.
      Cosmetic dentistry, which includes not only veneers but teeth whitening, bonding,
      and [Invisalign](http://50.18.194.110:40030/houston-tx/cosmetic-dentistry/invisalign/),
      does more than keep your teeth beautifully healthy. These cosmetic services
      can change the look of your smile so that it’s precisely what you want.'
  - heading: HOW LONG DO PORCELAIN VENEERS LAST?
    content: Porcelain veneers are amazing for their durability. With proper care
      and dental hygiene habits, they can last you 10 to 15 years before needing replacement.
      To ensure you get the most out of your veneers, be sure to brush and floss regularly,
      avoid grinding your teeth, and stay away from staining foods and drinks.
  - heading: DO VENEERS RUIN YOUR TEETH?
    content: No, porcelain veneers do not ruin your teeth. They actually have advantages
      over your natural enamel. Just like porcelain crowns do, veneers protect your
      teeth from further tooth decay and damage. Veneers are made of much sterner
      stuff than enamel, and they’re more resistant to stains.
  - heading: ARE VENEERS PERMANENT?
    content: Unfortunately, veneers are not a permanent solution to your smile. However,
      with excellent dental care and regular cleaning appointments with your dentist,
      you can make sure that your veneers last you a long time. Also, unless you are
      using a thinner brand like Lumineers, your teeth will have been shaved down
      slightly to fit your veneers. As such, we recommend that you receive replacement
      veneers in order to maintain your beautiful, healthy smile.
  - heading: DO VENEERS CHANGE YOUR FACE?
    content: Porcelain veneers can change your face. At NuDentistry, your cosmetic
      dentist will make sure that your new teeth not only fit perfectly for you now
      but will highlight the best features of your face. Depending on your needs,
      your veneers can widen your smile, emphasize your cheekbones, and even make
      your face appear more symmetrical. When you come in for your consultation, we’ll
      discuss which veneers will give you the exact look you want.
  - heading: WHAT IS THE BEST COLOR FOR VENEERS?
    content: There is no one-color-fits-all solution for dental veneers. Each person
      is different, and your teeth’s color should reflect their features and look
      natural. For patients looking only to change one or two teeth, we perfectly
      match your veneers to the rest of your teeth so that they blend in flawlessly.
      If you are looking into a more complete smile adjustment, then we will select
      your shade that helps your teeth pop and look their healthiest.
  - heading: CAN YOU GET VENEERS WITHOUT SHAVING YOUR TEETH?
    content: There are certain no-preparation veneers, like Lumineers, that do not
      require trimming your teeth down to fit them. They are thin enough that they
      can fit right over your teeth as-is without feeling bulky or uncomfortable.
  - heading: CAN I GET VENEERS ON JUST MY TWO FRONT TEETH?
    content: Absolutely! Veneers are meant to perfect your teeth only as you want
      them to. We treat each tooth individually, shaping and designing them so that
      you receive your best look. We can prepare anywhere between a single to 6 or
      8 veneers, depending on your needs.
